\citet{salloum2011dialectal,salloum2013dialectal} introduce rules based systems for converting dialectical arabic into standard arabic.
They propose a method for measuring the quality of their results by measuring how well it improves the BLEU score of a subsequent translation into English.

\citet{mager2018challenges} surveys the little work that has been done to study indigenous Latin American languages.
Studying Spanish dialects may help us improve our understanding of these languages because of the strong and localized influences.

\citet{costa2018neural} studies translation between European Portuguese to Brazilian Portuguese.
They claim this is the first translation study between language dialects using deep learning,
and provide references to systems using older techniques.
